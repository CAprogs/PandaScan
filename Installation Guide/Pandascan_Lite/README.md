## Good To Know üìù

### Failed downloads ‚ùå
---
If a `download fails`, there could be several reasons :
- The website's server is down.
- Your internet connection is monitered by a firewall that blocks the download.
- Your internet connection is too slow.
- The website has changed its data structure.

#### Try to :
- Delete the folder chapter's folder created and try again.
- Switch to another connection. (e.g. from WiFi to cellular data)
- Try again later if the website's server is down.
- Switch to another website ( your manga may be available on another website )

### Skipped downloads ‚è©
---
If a `download is skipped`, it means that :
- The chapter is already downloaded.
- A chapter with the same name already exists in the manga's folder.

There is an exception for `Fmteam` because it has its own naming convention.

This prevents you from downloading the same chapter twice.
