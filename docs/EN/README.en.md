## Important ⚠️

1. PandaScan 🐼 was created to facilitate the download and reading of your favorite manga locally. This project is non-profit and is intended for purely personal use.
2. Excessive and frequent downloading can cause a website to malfunction. Please use this tool responsibly for the good of all.
3. If some downloaded files are empty, it is completely normal! Websites are not perfect, and data storage can be costly.

_**If you can afford to buy the works you read online, do it, even just to support the mangakas**_ 🥰 !
