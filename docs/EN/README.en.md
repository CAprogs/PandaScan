## Important ⚠️

1. PandaScan 🐼 was created to facilitate the download and reading of your favorite mangas locally. This project is non-profit and intended for purely personal use.
2. Excessive and frequent downloading may cause a website to malfunction. Please use this tool responsibly for the benefit of all.
3. If some downloaded files are empty, it's completely normal! Websites are not perfect, and data storage can be costly.

_**If you can afford to buy the works you read online, do it, even if it's just to support the mangakas**_ 🥰!
