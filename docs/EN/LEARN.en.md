## **Introduction**

Hello 👋, I'm Charles, 22 years old, and I'm in my final year of engineering school at ECAM-EPMI Cergy in 🇫🇷 🎉

For the past few years, I've been passionate about computer science and programming in general! Like any typical student, I had to learn various programming languages during my studies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and more.

However, I found myself particularly drawn to learning Python 🐍, a language known for its simplicity and effectiveness. Machine Learning, Automation, App Development, and more—the possibilities with this language are vast and diverse. So, I took the plunge, and for the past few years, I've been constantly learning new things, whether through personal projects, courses, or YouTube videos!

In this document, we will delve into the journey of creating PandaScan 🐼, a project that holds a special place in my heart, from its initial idea to its implementation and beyond. The story that follows aims to convey my passion, share the challenges I encountered, and provide insights that shaped this project.
