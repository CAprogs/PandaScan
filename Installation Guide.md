### **I. FIRST STEP**
#

**Notes:** Paths looking different on OS.
- On **Windows** if you have a path like this : `User\Desktop\file_name` you can't use it and should redefine it as `User\\Desktop\\file_name`.

---
- **COPY** the path to your `.EXE` file in your chromedriver directory & **Paste** it in the `config.json` file as below ‚¨áÔ∏è

**Please Note:** (BETA version only)
- The **`chromedriver.EXE`** file may be blocked by your computer. ( especially for **Mac users** )

### **II. SECOND STEP**
#
I recommend using `conda` for this part. If you don't have **conda** you can install it using this [**link**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 

Why ? : _I'm currently using `miniconda3` with a `MacBook pro M1` chip. I downloaded the `.pkg` file from the latest release with `Python 3.10`. 
**Miniconda** is just a **lightweight distribution of Anaconda**._

For **Windows Users**, while downloading and installing Miniconda you should use the **Conda Powershell** to create and install your venv and then launch PandaScan.

- Open your **Terminal**
- Enter your **Miniconda** / **Anaconda** file with the following command ‚¨áÔ∏è
```
cd miniconda3
```
- Create a **Conda Virtual environnement** named **Pandavenv** ‚¨áÔ∏è
```
conda create --name Pandavenv
```
- Activate the **Venv** ‚¨áÔ∏è
```
conda activate Pandavenv
```

- Install `pip` in your `conda venv` using the following command ‚¨áÔ∏è
```
conda install pip
```

- Install the **requirements** using the following command ‚¨áÔ∏è
  - _Replace `path/to/requirements.txt` with your **requirements.txt** file path_
```
pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
```

#
### **III. THIRD STEP**
#
- Enter the PandaScan file ‚¨áÔ∏è
  - Replace `path/to/PandaScan` with your **PandaScan** file path ‚¨áÔ∏è
```
cd path/to/PandaScan
```

- **Launch** the **PandaScan** app ‚¨áÔ∏è
```
conda run python App.py
```
#

### **IV. FOURTH STEP ( Optional )**
#

If you don't want to use CLI, you can start **PandaScan** using [**VScode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ‚¨áÔ∏è
