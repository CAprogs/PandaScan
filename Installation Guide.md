### **I. FIRST STEP**
#

- Download and install [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ( **Python 3.12** is recommended )

Avoid using `conda`, it may cause some issues.

- Download [**Chromewebdriver**](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) ( Select the **right version** for your architecture as below )

- Then kill the process using **`Ctrl + C`** or just manually close the terminal.
- It may not work the first time for **`Mac users`** so follow these steps ‚¨áÔ∏è.

## Good To Know üìù
---

### Chromedriver Error ü§ñ ( BETA only )

If a `Chromedriver Error` occurs , there could be several reasons :

- You didn't download the right version of **Chromedriver** for your architecture.
- Your **Chromedriver version** doesn't `match` your **Chrome** version.
- **Chromedriver** is `blocked` by your computer. ( make sure you've allowed its execution )
- You didn't `paste` the right path to **Chromedriver**. ( on Windows, don't forget to add the `.exe` extension at the end of your path )

#

### Failed downloads ‚ùå

If a `download fails`, there could be several reasons :
- The website's server is down.
- Your internet connection is monitered by a firewall that blocks the download.
- Your internet connection is too slow.
- The website has changed its data structure.

#### Try to :
- Delete the folder chapter's folder created and try again.
- Switch to another connection. (e.g. from WiFi to cellular data)
- Try again later if the website's server is down.
- Switch to another website ( your manga may be available on another website )
#

### Skipped downloads ‚è©
If a `download is skipped`, it means that :
- The chapter is already downloaded.
- A chapter with the same name already exists in the manga's folder.

There is an exception for `Fmteam` because it has its own naming convention.

This prevents you from downloading the same chapter twice.
#

### Updates üîÑ ( BETA only )

There's two modes of update :
- **Manual** : this is the default mode. Only the current site's data will be updated.
- **Auto** : this mode will update all websites data when starting app.

Updates `depends on settings` you've chosen :
disabling a website's update will prevent the update from being performed for this specific website.
#

### ChangeLog üìù ( BETA only )

The `changelog` File helps you visualize if there's **any change** in a particular website's data.

- A `changelog` File is generate in _**src > changelog > websites > "select a website"**_ after each update.

#

### Settings ‚öôÔ∏è ( BETA only )

Settings are saved in `config.json`.

You can change them manually or using the **Settings** tab.

The only setting that doesn't require to restart app is the `download path` : the new path will be used for the next download.
